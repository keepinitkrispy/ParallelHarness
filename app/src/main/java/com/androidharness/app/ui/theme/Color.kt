/**
 * Google-blue–seeded Material 3 palettes.
 *
 * These are the fallback schemes used when wallpaper dynamic color is unavailable or
 * disabled (pre-Android 12 devices, or dynamicColor off). The seed is the Google Blue
 * (#0B57D0) used across Google's Material 3 apps.
 *
 * The tertiary ramp is deliberately a neutral slate instead of the default purple,
 * the UI does not use tertiary for branding, and a purple accent leaking through
 * chips/badges is exactly what made the old design feel noisy.
